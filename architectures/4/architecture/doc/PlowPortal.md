**Organization Name:** San Bernardino County – Department of Public Works
	
**Location of Organization:** San Bernardino, CA

**Executive Sponsor:** Shannon Bailey

**Primary Contact:** Shannon Bailey

**Organization’s Mission:**
>To enhance the quality of life for our diverse communities by developing and maintaining public infrastructure, and providing a variety of municipal services that complements our natural resources and environment.

**Describe the problem or opportunity to be addressed:**

>Snow Plow Route Optimization:
Opportunity: Develop new snow plow routes that optimize the efficiency of snow plowing operations. Analyze the variables and come up with an optimization tool for Public Works supervisors (e.g. Spreadsheet or GIS program). This trial study would be focused only on the Running Spring/Green Valley Lake area routes.
>1.	Evaluation of current routes and recommend route adjustments for optimization.
>2.	Automatically highlight when a different piece of heavy equipment should be used as snow accumulates (equipment speed and performance capabilities to be provided by Public Works)
>3.	Trigger points when a second piece of equipment or a route modification should be implemented to maintain the “passable” goal of 8 inches or less in the 10-hour period.
>4.	Provide estimated time to clear roads after storm has ended based on snowfall depth per storm.  


**What software applications or services are used today to help solve this problem?**

>None. Snow Route Check Sheet is available.


**Describe how you might be able to better serve your customers/stakeholders if a solution were implemented:**

>Increase plow intervals on a shift to lessen the accumulated snow on the roadway. Increase efficiency of Snow removal operations until streets have been cleared to their full widths. Optimization of the routes, ability to adjust route/equipment/manpower for variations encountered for each storm, reduced complaints by providing better customer service (faster plow times, less snow accumulation per shift). In addition, the tool will be expanded to other snow areas that Public Works and Public Works - Special Districts maintains.

**What would the key metrics of success be: (optional)**

>Reduce the approximate time to complete “Work After End of Storm” as shown in the Example Table below with different depths of snow.

| Depth of Snow During Storm | Approximate Time To Complete Work AFTER End of Storm |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 0” through 10”             | 24 hours                                             |
| 10 ½” through 20”          | 36 hours                                             |
| 20 ½” through 30”          | 48 hours                                             |
| 30 ½” through 40”          | 72 hours                                             |
| 40 ½” and up               | 96 hours                                             |  


**During our engagement, do you expect to provide data that is required to be protected from public view?** 

>County can provide GIS maps with current routes, spreadsheet with existing route mileage, type of equipment available for the routes, typical plowing speeds, and current staffing levels. Full access to historic data, road yard supervisors and regional superintendents, and public service database reports on complaints.

***San Bernardino County Launches PLOWPORTAL to Enhance Citizen Mobility and Staff Efficiency***

*San Bernardino, CA – November 1, 2022*

#### **Summary** 

San Bernardino Mountain News| CALIFORNIA - Today, San Bernardino County (SBC) went live with a new service to improve winter driving conditions and specifically snow plowing activities in the San Bernardino Mountains. When fully operational the service, accessed through https://plowportal.sbcounty.gov, will allow citizens, Emergency Medical Services (EMS), public safety and county personnel to view and report on numerous aspects of mountain road conditions.  The new technology integrates with familiar technologies including mobile map applications, the County’s GIS (Geographic Information System) and sends alerts though email and text message services.  In addition to better road conditions communications, it will improve the efficiency of snowplow activities though digitized and optimized routes, road closures, and snowplow equipment status, benefits for both county personnel and citizens.  

The portal intends to provide near real-time status of snow depth, blocked roads, and snowplow route completion / road plowing status.  The intent is to allow citizens and public service organizations to plan for an ingress/egress trip to residential and commercial properties throughout the mountain communities during winter storms.  

In addition to increasing snow removal operational efficiency, it also answers the question, “Can I get to my destination?”

#### **Problem**

Snowplow personnel and equipment are limited resources in the SBC mountain communities when winter storms arrive. While snowplow operators have developed comprehensive routes and workflow processes over many years, those routes currently exist as static paper-based assets, resulting in the status of plowed road conditions that are hidden to both mountain residents and public service personnel (e.g., EMS, police, fire, utility companies).  During a storm event, blocked roads can occur from downed trees/utilities or vehicles which impede staff and the public.  Vehicle blockage occurs when citizens or mountain visitors leave their vehicles encroaching into or directly upon roads that need to be cleared.  The common causes for vehicles blocking the roadways are ill-equipped vehicles (e.g. no chains, no four-wheel drive, lack of tire tread, dead battery, etc.) and a lack of preparation for an incoming storm which includes a lack of knowledge of mountain parking guidelines and regulations from October – April each year.  Road blockages cause road snow clearing delays or inability to fully clear a road.  Once the road blockage is cleared, plows must backtrack which causes further lost time on subsequent roads. Situations like this cause additional time and resources to complete snow removal operations and many frequent citizen concerns lodged with San Bernardino County Public Works.  

In addition to the interruption of snow clearing operations from road impediments, the County has experienced high turnover of both experienced and recently trained snowplow operators and struggles to bring new hires up to speed on both efficient snowplow operations and the complex routes they need to drive.  Sometimes new hires are onboarded only weeks before they need to perform their route, leading to concerns from the public about their ability to provide a consistent, high level of service.

#### **Approach** 

***PLOWPORTAL*** is SBC’s approach to the integration of new technologies and existing information systems into a real time, public-facing Web application and data-rich staff-facing portal that will make road conditions and snowplow route progress visible, so citizens can plan their movements to and from their residence and work locations during winter storm days.  Additionally, the staff-facing portal includes many tools: digitized routes, digitized snowplow route logs, and digitized snowplow maintenance logs, on-board video/photo feeds, among others.  Video/photo based training will provide excellent content for inexperienced snowplow operators to learn quickly, leveraging turn-by-turn guidance during both training and actual operations.  The vision for ***PLOWPORTAL*** is a common Web application with enhanced information specific to snowplowing operations.  

At the highest level PLOWPORTAL collects and integrates data from several sources:
- Digital route information that can be dynamically adjusted based on current conditions
- Snowplow on-board telematics including:
    - Live logs of current location, route covered, direction and speed
    - Equipment status: plowing/not plowing
- Predictive and live route information such as:
    - Expected time and distance until route completion
    - Current location of blocked or closed roadways
    - Realtime reporting of issues and events only visible to operators and supervisors
- Snowplow operators training resources: 
    - Video/photo documented routes 
    - Digital route paths 
    - Curated route paths from plow operators and supervisors showing obstacles and route considerations utilizing Cyclomedia data (360 degree/three-dimensional LiDAR imagery for generating realistic snowplow route conditions in operator virtual training applications)
- ESRI ArcGIS system storing and displaying many aspects of the county’s operations
- California Highway Patrol, EMS, Sheriff, Fire
- National Weather Service
- Cartegraph: SBC’s asset and maintenance system, work order and public concern portal
- Road Services: Caltrans, CHP Freeway Service Patrol, etc.
- Google Maps traffic data, Waze traffic data
- Capella: Synthetic Aperture Radar imaging

### **Customer Testimonials** 

#### **Citizen #1**
>During past storms, my workdays were filled with a worried eye on the snow accumulation outside my office window. Is my street plowed? Did my kids make it home from school? Will I make it home in time for dinner? Now, with the ***PLOWPORTAL*** Web application, I can follow which roads have been cleared and plan the path I should follow to get home. Stormy days are no longer such a worry, and I can give my full attention to doing my job.


#### **Citizen #2**

>I am an elderly resident and unable to clear snow from my driveway. I rely on Alex, an independent contractor to clear my driveway and berm. Instead of waiting hours or days to coordinate plowing efforts between SBC’s plowing and Alex, the ***PLOWPORTAL*** webapp allows Alex to plan his neighborhood plowing so my drive is plowed clear after the county’s plows have come by. I no longer feel trapped or like a second-class citizen. I feel safe.

#### **Citizen #3**

>Snowplowing by the county this year was a pleasant and helpful experience. Because I was notified prior to a weather event and could track estimated snowplowing times on my street via the internet, I was able to move our vehicles as were my neighbors, to allow for a quality and effective plowing job. This, in turn, provided me with mobility I’ve not experience in the past.

#### **Citizen #4**

>By being able to see when my street was plowed helps me plan for my trips into town. When the storms continue to drop snow, I can ensure I have all the supplies I need based on when I can safely leave and return to my house.

#### **Citizen #5**

>The change over the past year has been remarkable. My road is plowed as smooth as a putting green after every storm, always perfect, plus I can just log into the website to see the current status of road clearing in the parts of the county I need to travel”, said Pam Snowglobe of Lake Arrowhead.

### **Public Works Testimonials**

#### **Supervisor #1**

>In the past, snowplow location was available by logging into our fleet system and road status was only available at the end of a shift or when the driver phoned in an issue. Now, we can track real time status and route completion percentage in one place.  This helps my planning for the next shift, my overall high-level view of the current plowing situation in the County and any shortcomings that need to be addressed.

#### **Supervisor #2**

>The new computer based training helped the trainee so much this winter season. The trainee became a more efficient and confident operator, achieving maximum width with minimal passes and clean intersections. Constituents were completely satisfied. Due to the confidence and performance of the operator, I was able to free up my time to oversee other pressing issues.

#### **Trainee #1**

>As a trainee, I was overwhelmed by the thought of snowplowing in the mountains since I live down in San Bernardino. I decided to try being a snowplow operator because I understand the positive impact this has on the public.  My first training session started me on easy, flat streets and I drove the path with a supervisor, trying to remember exactly where to go.  I was able to use the PLOWPORTAL to virtually drive my paths and become mentally prepared, and then utilize the navigation tool in my plow to ensure no streets were missed. 

#### **Leadership #1**

>Since implementing the more efficient training program, the employees & residents have a better outlook on snow removal.

#### **Leadership #2**

>We have relied on the same routes for decades. With PLOWPORTAL we were able to make adjustments to our routes that improved efficiency and helped to maintain our plowing goals.
