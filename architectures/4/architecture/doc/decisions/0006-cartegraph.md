Related to [11. See Click Fix](0011-see-click-fix.md)

## Context

Cartegraph is the San Bernardino County asset management software. It currently manages all assest tracked by the County. As snowplow routes are documented electronically, Cartegraph would be a possible location to digitally store and track the routes. 

## Decision

The decision was made to not store snowplow routes in Cartegraph at this time.

## Consequences

Storage of snowplow routes in the Cartegraph system would require additional workload on County personnel..
