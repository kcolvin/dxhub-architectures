# 11. See Click Fix

Date: 2023-6-20

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Instead of using a web form with SB Access Online or call 909-884-4056, SeeClickFix is a great alternative for facilitating citizen engagement with communication between San Bernardino County and residents. The platform allows citizens to submit service requests to report any issues from their smartphone or computer (e.g. a fallen tree that could impeded a driver from plowing their routes). 

## Decision

To empower citizens, SBC SeeClickFix is expanded with 'Conversations'. It reduces web forms and the influx of phone calls, allowing public works employees to dedicate their time to other tasks.

## Consequences

SeeClickFix is well established in SBC and should be re-used to the fullest extent - unifying Citizen Relationship Management on a common platform in SBC. SeeClickFix is a fully managed SaaS offering with broad integrations with other digital civic solutions. Cost and time to deploy are expected to be negligible given SBC is an existing Civic Plus customer and SeeClickFix has already been made available to citizens through the SBC Department of Public Works.
