# 7. Waze

Date: 2023-4-25

## Status

Accepted

## Context

San Bernardino County had a subscription to Waze for crowd source traffic updates.

## Decision

The decision was to continue using Waze as the subscription had already been in use. Using Waze gave snowplow drivers more resources to understand traffic environment when deploying snow plows.

## Consequences

While there other alternatives for traffic information, Waze has already been implemented. Its feature set fully meets San Bernardino County's requirements.
