# 7. Waze

Date: 2023-6-19

## Status

Accepted

## Context

San Bernardino County has a subscription to Waze for crowd source traffic updates.  It would be possible to integrate real-time snowplow route data (cleared, blocked or impassible roads) into the Waze interface so County personnel and the public could view road status real-time.

## Decision

The decision was to not pursue snowplow route with the Waze service at this time.

## Consequences

The County and public suffer from unrealized Waze functionality. If this is a priority item, the decision could be revisited.
