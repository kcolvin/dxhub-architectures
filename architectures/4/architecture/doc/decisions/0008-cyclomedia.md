# 8. Cyclomedia

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Cyclomedia captures geospatial data which has street level imagery with the use of GPS technology. The georeferenced, 3D images are refered to as "GeoCycloramas". Using this technology during winter months could help with snow plow removal routes with snow-free, street level imagery exposing hidden features such as road barriers, fire hydrants, sign posts, etc.

## Decision

While the Cyclomedia technology is feasible for snowplow use and San Bernardino has basic functionaly enabled, it was not implemented in the current efforts. Lack of county personnel availability is the primary limited resource.

## Consequences

Unrealized functionality with existing systems is the primary consequence. Additinoally, there may be privacy concerns with Cyclomedia's high-resolution street imagery - not for public consumption.
