## Status

Accepted

## Context

Cyclomedia captures geospatial data which has street level imagery with the use of GPS technology. Using Cyclomedia could help with snow plow removal routes with street level imagery, measure snow depth on streets (***NOT SURE IF THIS HAD CHANGED), and utilizing historical archive of street imagery.

## Decision

Using Cartegraph could help with snowplow routes by taking images and overlaying it on the portal. The imagery would provide information to plan snow plow routes, condition of San Bernardino County's infrastructure assets, and snow accumulation depth measurement. This information could be used during a snow storm and provide community awareness and promote safety measures during snow storms.

## Consequences

There may be privacy concerns with Cyclomedia's high-resolution street imagery - not for public consumption.
