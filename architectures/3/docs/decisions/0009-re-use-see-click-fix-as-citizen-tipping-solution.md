# 9. See-Click-Fix will be used as the multi-channel solution for citizens to report illegal dumping 

Date: 2022-07-28

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Currently, SBC citizens are directed to fill out a web form on [SB Access Online](https://lus.sbcounty.gov/code-enforcement-home/) or call 909-884-4056 to report illegal dumping. Other departments, such as Public Works, rely on a popular cloud-based solution called [SeeClickFix by Civic Plus](https://seeclickfix.com/), (an [AWS Partner](https://partners.amazonaws.com/partners/001E000001Li93nIAB/Civic%20Plus)) to interact with citizens in their communities - also known as **Citizen Relationship Management**.

This illegal dumping tipping user experience could be optimized by providing a more unified, light-touch approach for citizens to communicate with their local government via the media of their choosing: app, SMS, email, phone, chatbot, social media, etc. This multi-channel experience is available from [SeeClickFix Conversations](https://www.civicplus.com/seeclickfix/conversations). 

## Decision

>Re-use and expand the SBC SeeClickFix implementation with "Conversations" 

## Consequences

Encouraging illegal dumping reporting from citizens has to be as frictionless as possible to gain engagement from the community - particularly given current light-touch usability expectations delivered from consumer services today. [SeeClickFix Conversations](https://www.civicplus.com/seeclickfix/conversations) allows citizens to report illegal dumping from the communication channel that individually suits them best to increase illegal dumping tips and citizen engagement in preventing illegal dumping.

SeeClickFix is well established in SBC and should be re-used to the fullest extent - unifying Citizen Relationship Management on a common platform in SBC. SeeClickFix is a fully managed SaaS offering with broad integrations with other digital civic solutions. Cost and time to deploy are expected to be negligible given SBC is an existing Civic Plus customer and SeeClickFix has already been made available to citizens through the SBC Department of Public Works.
