# 4. Develop sUAS capabilities within Code Enforcement Department

Date: 2022-07-28

## Status

Accepted

## Context

SBC presently has an emerging, yet fragmented, in-house UAS capability - disbursed throughout various departments (Fire, Public Works, Sheriff, etc.). and is in the early stages of formalizing their UAS program and supporting systems for scaled operations. Standardized training is being developed and delivered at [SBD Airport](https://flysbd.com/) by the [UAS Center](https://uascentersbd.com/).

Cloud-based tooling to support scaled, in-house UAS operations, such as [DroneDeploy](https://www.dronedeploy.com/) which was prototyped for this challenge, have made planning, flying, analyzing, and reporting from UAS missions highly automated and simple - allowing field specialists ready access to these imaging capabilities without having to rely on surveying experts.  

## Decision

>Identify candidate sUAS pilots within Code Enforcement to become [FAA Part 107](https://www.faa.gov/uas/commercial_operators) certified via the existing training program available at the UAS Center and equipped with commodity UAS hardware for routine mapping missions.

## Consequences

Directly training and equipping Code Enforcement personnel to conduct sUAS missions will provide high-quality, low-latency imagery to support abatement planning and execution - as well as address and recurring question heard through this challenge of "We don't know how large this dumping problem is."

Leveraging existing UAS training, pilots, and aircraft in SBC provides a clear path for Code Enforcement to rapidly introduce these emerging surveying capabilities into their workflows as they train up their workforce.
