# 1. Record architecture decisions in ADRs and C4 diagrams

Date: 2022-07-28

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Given the unique nature of the SBC challenges taken on by the DxHUB (a portfolio approach v. point solutions), a more formal process of recording key architecture decisions is advised for continuity among team members and stakeholders.

Management of Architecture Decision Records and Diagrams as Code is a best practice within AWS and other leading technology companies. Here are some examples from [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/architectural-decision-records/welcome.html) and [Spotify](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2022/07/software-visualization-challenge-accepted/).

## Decision

>For the DxHUB SBC Challenges, the team will use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions); supported by the [C4 Model](https://c4model.com/) for visualizing software architecture.

## Consequences

This approach to documenting key architecture decisions will provide SBC with an easily transferable road map of the knowledge and thinking associated with each challenge taken on by the DxHUB.
